/**
 * Recommends a set of items that are somehow related to one given item, *X*. A typical scenario is when the user *A* is viewing *X*. Then you may display items to the user that he might also be interested in. Recommend items to item request gives you Top-N such items, optionally taking the target user *A* into account.
 * The returned items are sorted by relevance (the first item being the most relevant).
 * Besides the recommended items, also a unique `recommId` is returned in the response. It can be used to:
 * - Let Recombee know that this recommendation was successful (e.g., user clicked one of the recommended items). See [Reported metrics](https://docs.recombee.com/admin_ui#reported-metrics).
 * - Get subsequent recommended items when the user scrolls down (*infinite scroll*) or goes to the next page. See [Recommend Next Items](https://docs.recombee.com/api#recommend-next-items).
 * It is also possible to use POST HTTP method (for example in the case of a very long ReQL filter) - query parameters then become body parameters.

class RecommendItemsToItem extends rqs.Request {

  /**
   * Construct the request
   * @param {string} itemId - ID of the item for which the recommendations are to be generated.
   * @param {string} targetUserId - ID of the user who will see the recommendations.
   * Specifying the *targetUserId* is beneficial because:
   * * It makes the recommendations personalized
   * * Allows the calculation of Actions and Conversions
   *   in the graphical user interface,
   *   as Recombee can pair the user who got recommendations
   *   and who afterward viewed/purchased an item.
   * If you insist on not specifying the user, pass `null`
   * (`None`, `nil`, `NULL` etc., depending on the language) to *targetUserId*.
   * Do not create some special dummy user for getting recommendations,
   * as it could mislead the recommendation models,
   * and result in wrong recommendations.
   * For anonymous/unregistered users, it is possible to use, for example, their session ID.
   * @param {number} count - Number of items to be recommended (N for the top-N recommendation).
   * @param {Object} optional - Optional parameters given as an object with structure name of the parameter: value
   * - Allowed parameters:
   *     - *scenario*
   *         - Type: string
   *         - Description: Scenario defines a particular application of recommendations. It can be, for example, "homepage", "cart", or "emailing".
   * You can set various settings to the [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com). You can also see the performance of each scenario in the Admin UI separately, so you can check how well each application performs.
   * The AI that optimizes models to get the best results may optimize different scenarios separately or even use different models in each of the scenarios.
   *     - *cascadeCreate*
   *         - Type: boolean
   *         - Description: If an item of the given *itemId* or user of the given *targetUserId* doesn't exist in the database, it creates the missing entity/entities and returns some (non-personalized) recommendations. This allows, for example, rotations in the following recommendations for the user of the given *targetUserId*, as the user will be already known to the system.
   *     - *returnProperties*
   *         - Type: boolean
   *         - Description: With `returnProperties=true`, property values of the recommended items are returned along with their IDs in a JSON dictionary. The acquired property values can be used to easily display the recommended items to the user. 
   * Example response:
   * ```json
   *   {
   *     "recommId": "0c6189e7-dc1a-429a-b613-192696309361",
   *     "recomms":
   *       [
   *         {
   *           "id": "tv-178",
   *           "values": {
   *             "description": "4K TV with 3D feature",
   *             "categories":   ["Electronics", "Televisions"],
   *             "price": 342,
   *             "url": "myshop.com/tv-178"
   *           }
   *         },
   *         {
   *           "id": "mixer-42",
   *           "values": {
   *             "description": "Stainless Steel Mixer",
   *             "categories":   ["Home & Kitchen"],
   *             "price": 39,
   *             "url": "myshop.com/mixer-42"
   *           }
   *         }
   *       ],
   *     "numberNextRecommsCalls": 0
   *   }
   * ```
   *     - *includedProperties*
   *         - Type: string[]
   *         - Description: Allows specifying which properties should be returned when `returnProperties=true` is set. The properties are given as a comma-separated list.
   * Example response for `includedProperties=description,price`:
   * ```json
   *   {
   *     "recommId": "6842c725-a79f-4537-a02c-f34d668a3f80",
   *     "recomms": 
   *       [
   *         {
   *           "id": "tv-178",
   *           "values": {
   *             "description": "4K TV with 3D feature",
   *             "price": 342
   *           }
   *         },
   *         {
   *           "id": "mixer-42",
   *           "values": {
   *             "description": "Stainless Steel Mixer",
   *             "price": 39
   *           }
   *         }
   *       ],
   *     "numberNextRecommsCalls": 0
   *   }
   * ```
   *     - *filter*
   *         - Type: string
   *         - Description: Boolean-returning [ReQL](https://docs.recombee.com/reql) expression, which allows you to filter recommended items based on the values of their attributes.
   * Filters can also be assigned to a [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com).
   *     - *booster*
   *         - Type: string
   *         - Description: Number-returning [ReQL](https://docs.recombee.com/reql) expression, which allows you to boost the recommendation rate of some items based on the values of their attributes.
   * Boosters can also be assigned to a [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com).
   *     - *logic*
   *         - Type: string | object
   *         - Description: Logic specifies the particular behavior of the recommendation models. You can pick tailored logic for your domain and use case.
   * See [this section](https://docs.recombee.com/recommendation_logics) for a list of available logics and other details.
   * The difference between `logic` and `scenario` is that `logic` specifies mainly behavior, while `scenario` specifies the place where recommendations are shown to the users.
   * Logic can also be set to a [scenario](https://docs.recombee.com/scenarios) in the [Admin UI](https://admin.recombee.com).
   *     - *userImpact*
   *         - Type: number
   *         - Description: **Expert option:** If *targetUserId* parameter is present, the recommendations are biased towards the given user. Using *userImpact*, you may control this bias. For an extreme case of `userImpact=0.0`, the interactions made by the user are not taken into account at all (with the exception of history-based blacklisting), for `userImpact=1.0`, you'll get a user-based recommendation. The default value is `0`.
   *     - *diversity*
   *         - Type: number
   *         - Description: **Expert option:** Real number from [0.0, 1.0], which determines how mutually dissimilar the recommended items should be. The default value is 0.0, i.e., no diversification. Value 1.0 means maximal diversification.
   *     - *minRelevance*
   *         - Type: string
   *         - Description: **Expert option:** If the *targetUserId* is provided:  Specifies the threshold of how relevant must the recommended items be to the user. Possible values one of: "low", "medium", "high". The default value is "low", meaning that the system attempts to recommend a number of items equal to *count* at any cost. If there is not enough data (such as interactions or item properties), this may even lead to bestseller-based recommendations being appended to reach the full *count*. This behavior may be suppressed by using "medium" or "high" values. In such case, the system only recommends items of at least the requested relevance and may return less than *count* items when there is not enough data to fulfill it.
   *     - *rotationRate*
   *         - Type: number
   *         - Description: **Expert option:** If the *targetUserId* is provided: If your users browse the system in real-time, it may easily happen that you wish to offer them recommendations multiple times. Here comes the question: how much should the recommendations change? Should they remain the same, or should they rotate? Recombee API allows you to control this per request in a backward fashion. You may penalize an item for being recommended in the near past. For the specific user, `rotationRate=1` means maximal rotation, `rotationRate=0` means absolutely no rotation. You may also use, for example, `rotationRate=0.2` for only slight rotation of recommended items.
   *     - *rotationTime*
   *         - Type: number
   *         - Description: **Expert option:** If the *targetUserId* is provided: Taking *rotationRate* into account, specifies how long it takes for an item to recover from the penalization. For example, `rotationTime=7200.0` means that items recommended less than 2 hours ago are penalized.
   *     - *expertSettings*
   *         - Type: object
   *         - Description: Dictionary of custom options.
   *     - *returnAbGroup*
   *         - Type: boolean
   *         - Description: If there is a custom AB-testing running, return the name of the group to which the request belongs.
