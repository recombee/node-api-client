/**
 * Merges interactions (purchases, ratings, bookmarks, detail views ...) of two different users under a single user ID. This is especially useful for online e-commerce applications working with anonymous users identified by unique tokens such as the session ID. In such applications, it may often happen that a user owns a persistent account, yet accesses the system anonymously while, e.g., putting items into a shopping cart. At some point in time, such as when the user wishes to confirm the purchase, (s)he logs into the system using his/her username and password. The interactions made under anonymous session ID then become connected with the persistent account, and merging these two becomes desirable.
 * Merging happens between two users referred to as the *target* and the *source*. After the merge, all the interactions of the source user are attributed to the target user, and the source user is **deleted**.
 * By default, the *Merge Users* request is only available from server-side integrations for security reasons, to prevent potential abuse.
 * If you need to call this request from a client-side environment (such as a web or mobile app), please contact our support and request access to enable this feature for your database.
